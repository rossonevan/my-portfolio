            <h1>In my free time, I am mostly on the computer. I have always had an interest in computers (how they worked, how they were put together). The most interesting things to me during my mechanical engineering degree were the 3D modeling design classes as well as the Arduino coding we created for a robotics class. I decided it was best to delve into the world of coding and learn the many facets of the tech world that I have always been interested in.</h1>

            <h1>At Flatiron School, I have learned Full Stack developer skills including JavaScript, JSX, HTML, CSS, React.js, Ruby and Ruby on Rails, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

            <br></br>
            <h1>In my career, I hope to utilize my skills learned from my mechanical engineering and software engineering experiences to assist a dynamic company with the best of my abilities to better help my employer and provide the best support for the customer.</h1>
